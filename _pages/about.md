I am Chongzhou Fang, a PhD candidate at University of California, Davis. My main research interest lies in heterogeneous cloud and edge security. I focus on both scheduler security and side-channel attack &amp; defense in heterogeneous computing resources like FPGAs. I also expolore how LLM techniques can be applied to to the field of system security.
