I am Chongzhou Fang, a PhD candidate at University of California, Davis. My main research interest lies in heterogeneous cloud and edge security. I focus on both scheduler security and side-channel attack and defense in heterogeneous computing resources like FPGAs. I also do security-related research on LLMs.

I'll be on the academic job market later this year.
